After running `code.py`  you will get flag.txt and uploads in terminal ..  But remember our AIM .  

# Goal is to  Get Flag after uploading payload Embedded Image and running `whoami` after connecting from nc



# Use RTLO to Triagger RCE and Keep Checking Metadata :)

# Things to Consider

  1.You have to upload your image inside upload directory, then enter the name of image after running code .  
  
  2.As this is focused on using RTLO , so embed payload with rtlo method used .
  
  3. use     `nc localhost port` to connect .

  4. only run `whoami`  to get flag.
